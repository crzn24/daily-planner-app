# Daily Planner Application

## Description
This project was a challenge assigned to us where we had to create a daily planner application from starter HTML and CSS code but we were not given any JavaScript starter code. 

Once you open the app, the current date is displayed at the top and you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. The time blocks are color coded to show the past, present, and future time. When you click on the block, you can enter event text, and when you click on the save button, the text is saved in local storage, which will save even when the page is refreshed.



## Usage
This application can serve as daily planner and its creation was a way to practice JavaScript, jQuery, and moment.
